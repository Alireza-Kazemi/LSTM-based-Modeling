# LSTM-based-Modeling and explaination of RT out of EEG

Source code DL and ML analysis in "A Deep Method for Prediction and Modeling of Behavioral Measurement from an Arbitrary Period of EEG" paper

1- Build filtered data using files in the folder Phase-Amp Perturbation

2- Train/validate the LSTM models (on full frequency range and sub-bands). Then test on spatial locations by running codes in the folder TrainModels. 

3- Run the Multi-level Regression

4- Run the statistical analysis
